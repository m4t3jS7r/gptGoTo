# ChatGPT Navigation Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension simplifies navigation in ChatGPT conversations by allowing users to jump to custom responses without clicking arrows. It also enables navigation through responses using the Page Up and Page Down keys.

## How to Use the Extension
1. Download or clone the repository files into a local folder.
2. Open Chrome, go to the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`), and enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click on **Load unpacked**, then select the folder containing the extension files (make sure the files are unzipped).
The extension is now ready for use.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
For easier navigation, the following shortcuts are available:
- **Shortcut to Activate Extension**: `Ctrl + Shift + L`
  - This shortcut will automatically activate the extension in Chrome.
- **Page Up/Down Functionality**: 
  - Use the **Page Up** key to go to the next response in the conversation.
  - Use the **Page Down** key to go to the previous response in the conversation.

**Note**: The extension currently works only on the [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) website (as of the testing date: September 15, 2024). 
It specifically operates in scenarios where the conversation contains only one user input and multiple revisions (e.g., a single chat thread).
